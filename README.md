# Wordle API Service — Senior Engineer Challenge

**Total time: 45 minutes** (Phase 1: 15 min, Phase 2: 30 min)

## Overview

This is a two-phase challenge designed to assess debugging, system design, and prioritization skills. You're given a buggy Wordle service that needs fixing, then you'll extend it with production-ready features.

**Important:** You won't finish everything in Phase 2 — we want to see how you prioritize and communicate tradeoffs.

## Setup

```bash
npm install
npm test              # Run all tests
npm run test:phase1   # Run only Phase 1 tests (recommended to start)
npm run demo          # See the bugs in action
```

---

# 🔧 PHASE 1: Debug & Fix (15 minutes)

## Your Task

Fix the bugs in `WordleService.ts`. Your job:

1. **Run the tests** (`npm test`) and analyze the failures
2. **Identify the root causes** (there are multiple bugs in WordleService)
3. **Fix the bugs** in `WordleService.ts`
4. **Get all WordleService tests passing**

**Note:** You'll see some WordleSolver tests failing too - those are for Phase 2, ignore them for now.

## What We're Looking For

- Can you quickly diagnose issues from test output?
- Do you understand the Wordle duplicate-letter algorithm?
- Can you spot race conditions and concurrency bugs?

## Hints

- The demo script (`npm run demo`) shows the bugs visually
- Some bugs are in the game logic, others in validation and concurrency
- Read the test descriptions carefully — they reveal expected behavior

## Wordle Rules Reference

Standard Wordle letter coloring:
- **Green (0)**: Correct letter in correct position
- **Yellow (1)**: Letter exists in answer but wrong position
- **Grey (2)**: Letter not in answer (or already accounted for)

For duplicate letters: Process exact matches (green) first, then wrong-position matches (yellow), tracking which answer letters are "used up."

# 🚀 PHASE 2: Production Features (30 minutes)

**You now have a working Wordle service. Time to make it production-ready.**

Choose **ONE** track below based on your strengths. You can switch tracks, but focus on doing one thing well rather than three things poorly.

## Track A: Algorithm (Solver Implementation)

**Challenge:** Build an optimal Wordle solver

Implement a solver that can guess any word in **≤ 4 attempts** using information theory:

```typescript
class WordleSolver {
  /**
   * Given the current game state (previous guesses + results),
   * return the optimal next guess that minimizes expected
   * remaining possibilities.
   *
   * Your solver will be tested against 100 random words.
   * Target: 95% solved in ≤4 guesses, 100% in ≤6 guesses
   */
  getNextGuess(
    previousGuesses: Array<{guess: string, result: LetterCode[]}>,
    wordList: string[]
  ): string;
}
```

**Evaluation:**
- Algorithm correctness (does it find valid solutions?)
- Optimization strategy (information entropy, frequency analysis, etc.)
- Performance (can it run in real-time?)
- Code clarity and explanation of approach

## Track B: Scale (System Design)

**Challenge:** Design for 1M concurrent users

The service needs to scale. Design and document:

1. **Persistence Strategy**
   - What database? (SQL vs NoSQL vs Redis vs...)
   - Schema design
   - Indexing strategy

2. **Caching Layer**
   - What to cache? (game state, dictionary, daily words?)
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Distributed caching (Redis cluster?)

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Memory usage (current Map grows unbounded)
   - Game cleanup/TTL strategy
   - Connection pooling
   - Read replicas

4. **New Features**
   - **Daily Puzzle Mode**: Same word for all users each day
   - **Statistics Tracking**: Win rate, guess distribution per user
   - **Leaderboards**: Fastest solvers today

**Deliverable:**
- Write a `DESIGN.md` with your architecture decisions
- Implement 1-2 key features (daily puzzle or stats tracking)
- Add appropriate error handling, logging, and monitoring hooks

**Evaluation:**
- Architectural thinking and tradeoff analysis
- Scalability considerations
- Production-readiness (logging, monitoring, error handling)
- Clear communication of decisions

## Track C: Features (Hard Mode + Multiplayer)

**Challenge:** Implement advanced game modes

Add these features to the service:

1. **Hard Mode**
   - Any revealed hints (green/yellow letters) MUST be used in subsequent guesses
   - Green letters must stay in same position
   - Yellow letters must be included but can move
   - Validate each guess follows these rules

2. **Multiplayer Race Mode**
   - Two players compete on the same word simultaneously
   - First to solve wins
   - Real-time updates (simulate with polling or webhook concept)
   - Handle edge cases (both solve on same turn, one quits mid-game)

3. **Statistics System**
   - Track per-user stats: games played, win rate, guess distribution
   - Current streak tracking
   - Best/worst performances

**Deliverable:**
- Implement at least 2 of the 3 features above
- Write comprehensive tests for your new features
- Handle edge cases gracefully

**Evaluation:**
- Feature completeness and correctness
- Edge case handling
- Test coverage
- Code organization

## Dictionary API

The `DictionaryService` provides:
- `isValidWord(word: string): Promise<boolean>` — async validation (10-50ms simulated latency)
- `getRandomWord(): string` — returns a random 5-letter word
- `getAllWords(): string[]` — get all words (useful for solver)

|----------|--------|
| Identifies root causes correctly | 15% |
| Fixes duplicate letter algorithm | 15% |
| Handles concurrency properly | 10% |

### Phase 2 (60%)
| Criteria | Weight |

## Tips

### General
- **Talk through your thinking** — we want to understand your approach
- **Ask clarifying questions** — requirements may be intentionally ambiguous
- **Prioritize ruthlessly** — you won't finish everything in Phase 2
- **Focus on correctness over optimization** — working code beats fast broken code

### Phase 1
- Use the test output to guide your debugging
- The demo script visualizes the bugs clearly
- Don't over-engineer the fixes — simple solutions are fine

### Phase 2
- **Pick ONE track** and do it well
- Document your tradeoffs and decisions
- Production code needs error handling, logging, and tests
- If you have time, you can switch tracks or combine approaches

### What Success Looks Like
- ✅ Phase 1 done in 15 minutes with all tests passing
- ✅ Clear explanation of the bugs and fixes
- ✅ Phase 2 has 1-2 polished features with tests and documentation
- ✅ Thoughtful discussion of tradeoffs and alternative approaches

## Example Scenarios (Phase 2)

### If You Choose Track A (Solver):
```typescript
// Example usage
const solver = new WordleSolver();
const guess1 = solver.getNextGuess([], allWords); // → "CRANE" (good starter)

const result1 = [GREY, YELLOW, YELLOW, GREY, GREY]; // C=grey, R=yellow, A=yellow, N=grey, E=grey
const guess2 = solver.getNextGuess([{guess: "CRANE", result: result1}], allWords); // → "ROAST" or similar

// Continue until solved...
```

### If You Choose Track B (Scale):
```markdown
# DESIGN.md excerpt

## Database Choice: PostgreSQL

**Decision:** Use PostgreSQL with JSONB for game state

**Rationale:**
- Need ACID guarantees for concurrent game updates
- JSONB allows flexible schema for game state
- Excellent indexing for leaderboard queries
- Battle-tested at scale

**Schema:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE games (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,
  answer TEXT NOT NULL,
  state JSONB NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  completed_at TIMESTAMP
);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_active_games ON games(user_id) WHERE completed_at IS NULL;
```

**Caching Strategy:**
- Redis for active game state (TTL 1 hour)
- Read-through cache pattern...
```

### If You Choose Track C (Features):
```typescript
// Hard mode example
const gameId = service.startGame({
  answer: 'CRANE',
  hardMode: true
});

await service.submitGuess(gameId, 'APPLE');
// Result: A=yellow, P=grey, P=grey, L=grey, E=yellow

// Next guess MUST include A and E (the yellows)
await service.submitGuess(gameId, 'STALE');
// ✅ Valid (has A and E)

await service.submitGuess(gameId, 'STORM');
// ❌ Invalid in hard mode — missing A and E
// throws ValidationError("Hard mode: must use revealed hints")
```

Good luck! Remember: **communication and decision-making** matter more than finishing everything.
